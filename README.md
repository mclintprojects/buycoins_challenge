# BuyCoins challenge

## Overview
This project is a Ruby on Rails GraphQL API using Ruby 2.5.1 and Rails 6.0.2. Ensure you have both Ruby and Rails with their respective versions correctly set up before proceeding with the rest of the setup instructions below. If you don't want to set up anything, you can play around with the [Heroku hosted version](https://mc-bycn.herokuapp.com/graphiql) instead.
